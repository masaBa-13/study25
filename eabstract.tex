This study focuses on the quantitative visualization of fishing operations to promote the coexistence of offshore wind power and coastal fisheries. To achieve this, a methodology was developed to analyze operational realities by integrating GNSS tracking data, landing records, fishing logbook data, and fuel records. Application of this method to the tuna longline fishery in Matsumae, Hokkaido, revealed that while primary fishing grounds do not directly overlap with the designated offshore wind power promotion area, navigation routes between ports and these grounds intersect the area. Specifically, the analysis estimated that a one-nautical-mile increase in travel distance per trip resulting from offshore wind farm construction would lead to an annual increase of approximately 4,330 liters in fuel consumption. In addition, the study identified seasonal patterns with operational efficiency peaking in July and August and established baselines for catch per unit effort (CPUE; catch per fishing operation) and fuel efficiency. Finally, a comparative validation demonstrated that although excluding logbook data resulted in extracting approximately 1.7 times more GNSS data points, the overall spatial distribution trends of fishing activity remained consistent.
