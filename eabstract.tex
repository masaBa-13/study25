In this research, I addressed the quantitative visualization of fishing operations to promote the coexistence of offshore wind power and coastal fisheries. I proposed a methodology to analyze operation realities by integrating GNSS tracking data, landing records, fishing logbook data, and fuel records. Applying this method to the tuna longline fishery in Matsumae, Hokkaido, the results revealed that while primary fishing grounds do not directly overlap with the designated promotion area, the navigation routes from ports to these grounds cross the area. My analysis estimated that an increase of 1 nautical mile (nm) in travel distance per trip due to offshore wind farm construction would lead to an annual increase of approximately 4,330 liters in fuel consumption. Additionally, I identified that operational efficiency peaks in July and August and established baselines for CPUE and fuel efficiency. A comparative validation showed that excluding logbook data resulted in extracting approximately 1.7 times more GNSS data points, yet the spatial distribution trends remained similar.
