The aim of this study is the quantitative visualization of fishing operations to promote the coexistence of offshore wind power and coastal fisheries. To achieve this aim, I proposed a methodology which can analyze operational realities by integrating GNSS tracking data, landing records, fishing logbook data, and fuel records. In the case of the tuna longline fishery in Matsumae, Hokkaido, this method showed primary fishing grounds do not directly overlap with the designated offshore wind power promotion area ;however, navigation routes between ports and these grounds intersect the area. If travel distance per trip increases by one nautical mile due to offshore wind farm construction, the analysis calculated that it would lead to an annual increase in fuel consumption of approximately 31 liters per vessel. In addition, the study identified seasonal patterns with operational efficiency peaking in July and August and established baselines for catch efficiency and fuel efficiency. Also, a comparative validation showed that excluding logbook data resulted in extracting approximately 1.7 times more GNSS data points; the overall spatial distribution trends of fishing activity, though, remained almost the same.
